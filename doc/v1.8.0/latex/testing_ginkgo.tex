\hypertarget{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Running the unit tests}\label{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md7}
You need to compile ginkgo with {\ttfamily -\/D\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+TS=ON} option to be able to run the tests.\hypertarget{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{Using make test}\label{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md8}
After configuring Ginkgo, use the following command inside the build folder to run all tests\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make test}
\end{DoxyCode}


The output should contain several lines of the form\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Start  1: path/to/test}
\DoxyCodeLine{1/13 Test  \#1: path/to/test .............................   Passed    0.01 sec}
\end{DoxyCode}


To run only a specific test and see more details results (e.\+g. if a test failed) run the following from the build folder\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./path/to/test}
\end{DoxyCode}


where {\ttfamily path/to/test} is the path returned by {\ttfamily make test}.\hypertarget{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{Using make quick\+\_\+test}\label{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md9}
After compiling Ginkgo, use the following command inside the build folder to run a small subset of tests that should execute quickly\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make quick\_test}
\end{DoxyCode}


These tests do not use G\+PU features except for a few device property queries, so they may still fail if Ginkgo was compiled with G\+PU support, but no such G\+PU is available. The output is equivalent to {\ttfamily make test}.\hypertarget{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsection{Using C\+Test}\label{testing_ginkgo_autotoc_md10}
The tests can also be ran through C\+Test from the command line, for example when in a configured build directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ctest -\/T start -\/T build -\/T test -\/T submit}
\end{DoxyCode}


Will start a new test campaign (usually in {\ttfamily Experimental} mode), build Ginkgo with the set configuration, run the tests and submit the results to our C\+Dash dashboard.

Another option is to use Ginkgo\textquotesingle{}s C\+Test script which is configured to build Ginkgo with default settings, runs the tests and submits the test to our C\+Dash dashboard automatically.

To run the script, use the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ctest -\/S cmake/CTestScript.cmake}
\end{DoxyCode}


The default settings are for our own CI system. Feel free to configure the script before launching it through variables or by directly changing its values. A documentation can be found in the script itself.
